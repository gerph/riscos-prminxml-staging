<chapter title="About these documents">
<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The documentation in this collection is a staging area for documentation that does not yet have
any home. It is intended to hold documents which are partially complete, or which are useful but
yet ready for acceptance into general documentation.
</p>
</section>

<section title="Collection areas">
<p>
    There are different areas in this collection, which are intended to arbitrarily divide
    the content into their source or intended use. The structure here is not intended to
    be indicative of the final structure of the documentation.
</p>

<subsection title="Functional specs ('acorn')">
    <p>
        This area is intended to contain functional specifications from the Acorn era which
        have not yet made it to PRM documentation. Functional specifications contain references
        to design and implementation decisions and discussion of problems with the system
        which are not appropriate for the reference manuals. However they are important steps
        along to way to creating documentation,
