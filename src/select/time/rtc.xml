<chapter title="Real Time Clock">
<section title="Introduction">

<p>
The Real Time Clock has previously been handled by the Kernel. With Kernel
8.64 and later the clock is managed by the RTC module. This communicates
with the hardware driver through a vector (RTCV) whose default claimant
is the RTCHW module. The RTCHW module provides implementations for the
RiscPC, A7000-series, RiscStation, and A9.
</p>

<p>
The RTC module provides the Kernel SWI OS_ResyncTime and all the OS_Word 14
and 15 operations to control the clock. A new reason code has been added to
<reference type='swi' name='OS_Word' reason='15'/>
for setting the clock's 5 byte time directly.
</p>

<p>
A separate section describes the RTCV vector.

<use>

<p>This service is issued by the RTC module to inform clients that the software
and hardware clocks have been synchronised. It may indicate that an
indeterminate period of inactivity has taken place, such as after returning
from a suspend state. Where possible, timed events should be synchronised
and where necessary appropriate action taken to ensure that queued events
take place.
</p>

<p>This service should never be claimed.</p>

This call is used to set the Real Time Clock to a time value as a UTC time.
It avoids the requirement to convert a UTC time to a locale-specific time
string first.
</p>

<p>
This call was new to RISC OS 4.

This SWI is used to cause the software clock to be resynchronised with the
hardware clock, where available. When changed, a service call
<reference type="service" name="RTCSynchronised" /> will be issued.
