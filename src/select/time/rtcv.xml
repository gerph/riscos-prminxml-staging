<chapter title="Real Time Clock Vector">
<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The Real Time Clock Vector is a means for alternate clock implementations to
be provided for differing hardware. The calls which are provided by the
Operating System (either within the Kernel or through an extension module)
for setting the system time - OS_Word 14 calls - are decoded and passed to
this vector for processing.
</p>

<p>
The time values passed to the RTCV handlers will be specified as UTC time.
That is, they will have had any time zone or daylight saving time adjustments
removed from them. Handlers should use the values directly with the suitable
hardware.
</p>

<p>
Certain clock implementations, for example the RiscPC clock chip, do not
provide sufficient information to allow the values to be read directly
from the chip and returned. In such cases additional steps may be taken
by the hardware driver.
</p>

<p>
The RiscPC clock chip driver code is limited by only storing a year value
in the range 0-3. As such, two NVRAM bytes have been allocated to augment
this (byte &hex;80 and &hex;81). Should similar adjustments be required for other
hardware it is recommended that these bytes be used. During the vector call
it is safe to issue NVRAM OS_Byte calls.

<use>
<p>This reason code is called when it is necessary to synchronise the internal
clock with the hardware-supplied time source. For devices which take a
significant time to be read the driver may initiate a request of the time
from the hardware and pass on the call. When the hardware has been read
such a driver should call SWI OS_ResyncTime request to update the Operating
System with the new values and notify other clients of an updated internal
clock.
</p>

<p>
Where inaccurate values are available from hardware the driver should
return the middle value for the relevant range.

to a specific value. The Operating System's internal representation will not
yet have been updated to reflect these values. Any of the values passed in
R1-R8 value may be -1 to indicate that it is not to be modified.</p>
