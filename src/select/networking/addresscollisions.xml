<chapter title="Internet address collisions">
<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The Internet module now issues a service when it detects another system
on the network with the same address. Components may recover from this by
reconfiguring the interface.

<use>
<p>This service call is issued by the Internet module (version 5.08 or later)
when it detects a machine using a duplicate IP address. This is normally
detected when an incoming ARP packet is received with our IP address but a
different hardware address.</p>

<p>
As a probe, whenever an interface is reconfigured, the Internet module sends
out an ARP request for our IP address to make any such machines reply. That
will then trigger this service call.</p>

<p>
Normally, the Internet module will shut down outright as a safety measure if
this happens. However, if this service call is claimed it will continue
operation. It is expected that anyone claiming this service call should take
appropriate action; for example the DHCP module might remove our IP address,
send a DHCPDECLINE message and go back into the DHCP INIT state.
