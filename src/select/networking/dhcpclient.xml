<chapter title="DHCPClient">
<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The DHCPClient module provides an implementation of the 'Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol'. This allows a server to allocate addresses to a
client based on its internal ethernet 'MAC' address.
</p>

<p>
The module is able to control multiple interfaces simultaneously.
Information about the DHCP configuration process is recorded to the DHCP
log.

<p>This service call is issued by the Internet module (version 5.28 or later)
when a BOOTP/DHCP reply is received.  Clients may inspect the contents of
the buffer to extract any configuration information.</p>

<p>
If you want to alter information in the buffer you may do so, but you must
then claim the service call by setting R1 to zero on exit.  If the service
call is claimed the Internet module will reprocess the buffer as if it had
just arrived from the network. Another Service_InternetStatus 4 will arrive
in due course.
</p>

<p>
    You should not normally claim this service call.

<p>This service call is issued by the DHCPClient module whenever it receives an
offer of an IP address lease which is better than its current best choice
(or if it is the first acceptable offer). You may inspect the buffer, but it
must not be modified.
</p>

<p>
If clients choose to retain information about offers they MUST use the value
of OPTION_SERVERIDENTIFIER as an opaque key to identify which offer has been
chosen.
</p>

<p>
If you claim this service the DHCPClient module will not accept the offer, but
will wait for another offer to be made.
</p>

<p>
    You should not normally claim this service call.

This service call is issued by the DHCPClient module (after 0.37) when it
has successfully configured an interface with an address leased from a DHCP
server. If the interface is reconfigured, the server releases the lease,
the server fails to renew the lease, a duplicate address is identified, or
the network stack is stopped, the lease will be lost and
InternetStatus_DHCPLeaseLost will be issued. This service will not be
reissued for renewals of the lease.

This service should never be claimed.

issued because of a manual reconfiguration).

<p>This command is used to control whether the DHCPClient module will configure the network automatically
    using the DHCP protocol.</p>

<p>
If no prefix is applied to the interface name the interface will be added to
the list of those controlled by the DHCP module.

<p>
If a '-' prefix is used, the interface name will be removed from those
controlled by the DHCP module and any address which is in use will be
removed.

If a '+' prefix is used, an existing DHCP lease on that interface will be
renewed, or a new attempt to obtain a lease will be made.
