<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The ZeroConf module deals with Link-Local zero-configuration network address
assignment. This module has been present since Select 3. The implementation
follows that of RFC3927. The module can only handle a single interface. It
will be automatically configured by the InetConfigure module when 'Dynamic'
network addressing is configured.
</p>

<p>
The ZeroConf module will always configure alias 9 of an interface, for
example 'eh0:9'.
</p>

<subsection title="Conformance">
<p>
The ZeroConf module and other components of the stack follow the protocol
laid down by this RFC with certain caveats:
</p>

<p>
<list>
<item>Link-local addresses assigned to interfaces with routable addresses will
    continue to be advertised by the Internet stack through the SIOCGIFCONF
    interface. (1.9 rule 2)</item>

<item>No operational changes have been made to prevent the issuing of
    link-local packets to a router, or forwarding by a router if so
    configured. (2.6.2, 2.7, 7)</item>

<item>The use of subnetting is not prevented. (2.8)</item>

<item>DNS addresses supplied by external sources may be cached for link-local
    addresses. (2.9)</item>

<item>DNS server may provide locally known link-local addresses. (2.9)</item>

<item>Operation where multiple interfaces use link-local addresses is not
    supported by the ZeroConf module and, where manual configuration occurs
    is not expected to route correctly. (3)</item>
</list>
</p>

<p>
Select 3 ZeroConf implementation follows draft 7 of the link-local standard
and had the following differences from the released RFC:
</p>

<p>
<list>
<item>4 probes will be sent initially (RFC now states 3).</item>

<item>The maximum number of conflicts before rate limiting was 60 (RFC now
     states 10).</item>
</list>
