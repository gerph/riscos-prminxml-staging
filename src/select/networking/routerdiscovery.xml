<chapter title="RouterDiscovery">
<section title="Introduction">
<p>
The RouterDiscovery module implements RFC1256 Router Discovery for multiple
interfaces as hosts or routers. The action of the RouterDiscovery must be
triggered by the user in order to be used. It is expected that address
configuration clients will perform this trigger when appropriate. ZeroConf
would be expected to trigger RouterDiscovery if no other address has been
configured. DHCP would be expected to trigger RouterDiscovery if the
relevant options are returned in the DHCP packets from the configuration
server.
</p>

<p>
The module will monitor interface changes and resend solicitations or
advertisements as appropriate. Non-availability of the router system
is not currently checked for.
</p>

<p>
Multiple interfaces are supported.

This service call is issued by the RouterDiscovery module when it starts
monitoring an interface for router advertisement packets. The module will
start by issuing solicitations. Once an advertisement is received the module
will modify the default route appropriately.
</p>
<p>
This service should never be claimed.

This service call is issued by the RouterDiscovery module when it starts
issuing advertisements on an interface. The module will initially issue a
few advertisements, before settling into a much more leisurely advertisement
every 10 minutes. If a solicitation is received from a host, an
advertisement will be made.
